# Todo List CLI App

A command-line Todo List application built in Python.  
This project was created as a learning experience while coding entirely from a mobile environment.  
It focuses on simplicity, clean logic, and understanding how CLI programs actually work.

## Features

- Add new tasks directly from the terminal  
- View all tasks in a clean list format  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Stores tasks permanently using a local file (JSON or text file)  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly codebase

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me several important concepts:

### • File Handling  
Understanding how to read, write, and update data in external files so that tasks persist after closing the program.

### • CLI Argument Parsing  
Learning how to accept commands like `add`, `list`, `remove`, and process them inside Python.

### • Structuring a Python Project  
Separating logic into functions, keeping the code modular, and making it easy to extend.

### • Error Handling  
Managing edge cases like empty inputs, missing files, invalid task numbers, etc.

### • Writing Clean, Readable Code  
Organizing functions and keeping things simple so the app stays easy to use and maintain.
